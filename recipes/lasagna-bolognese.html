        <h2>  
            It’s the authentic recipe born in the city of Bologna,<br>
            WITHOUT MOZZARELLA. Oh yes, because,<br> contrary to 
            popular belief, the authentic classic<br> recipe of 
            Lasagna Bolognese does NOT want mozzarella.

        <h2>  Steps for Bolognese Sauce  </h2>

        <ol>

            <li>

                First cut the carrot, celery and onion in very 
                tiny pieces.<br> The more the better. Set aside. 
                Then cut the pancetta<br> as finely as possible with
                 a sharp knife or a food processor.<br> Now place 
                 the minced pancetta in a saucepan.<br> Cook on 
                 medium heat for about 5 minutes,<br> stirring with 
                 a wooden spoon from time to time.

            </li>

            <br>

            <li> 

                Add the extra virgin olive oil and the finely 
                chopped<br> vegetables. Stir and cook over medium<br> 
                heat for 5 minutes, stirring. Then add the 
                ground beef.

            </li>

            <br>

            <li>

                Stir and cook for 5 minutes over medium / high 
                heat.<br> Now put the heat on high and add the<br> white
                 wine. Stir and let it evaporate.

            </li>

            <br>

            <li>

                Finally add the tomato passata. Cover with a lid
                and<br> simmer over LOW heat for about 2 hours.<br> If 
                the sauce dries too much during cooking,<br> add a 
                little meat broth. Towards the end,<br> add the 
                milk to dampen the acidity of the tomato.<br> 
                Season with salt and pepper. Bolognese Sauce 
                is ready<br> when you can see an oily, creamy 
                sauce on the surface.

            </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>  While the Bolognese sauce is cooking, make the béchamel.  </h3>

        <h2>  Steps for Bechamel Sauce  </h2>

        <ol>

            <li>

                In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat 
                then add the flour<br> – using a flour sieve – 
                while mixing QUICKLY with a whisk.<br> Cook for 30 
                sec/1 min stirring, so the flour becomes<br> tastier
                and absorb the butter fats.<br> The mixture of 
                butter and flour is called roux and it should<br>
                be a nice golden color. Now set aside and let<br>
                it cool. Meanwhile heat the milk, without
                bringing to a boil.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>

                Pour the milk slowly over the roux, while 
                stirring vigorously<br> with a whisk to prevent 
                the formation of lumps. When the milk<br> is 
                completely poured over the roux sauce,<br> put the 
                saucepan back on low heat.<br> Keep mixing 
                constantly, until you have a fairly thick 
                consistency<br> (about 10/15 minutes). The sauce 
                is ready when it sticks to the back of a wooden<br> 
                spoon. Finally, add a pinch of fine salt and <br>
                grated nutmeg to taste.

            </li>

        </ol>

        <h2>  Main Preparation</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>

                Preheat the oven at 190° (380 F). Spread on the
                bottom<br> of a baking dish (better ceramic or
                pirex) two tablespoons of bechamel.<br> Then put
                a lasagna noodle over it, trying to cover<br>
                the entire bottom of the pan. If one<br>
                lasagna is not enough for you, use<br> another
                one, whole or in half, depending on the
                size of the lasagna.<br> Layer on two
                tablespoons of bolognese sauce and 
                two of bechamel sauce.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>

                With the help of a tablespoon, cover the entire
                surface of the lasagna.<br> In the end, sprinkle
                two tablespoons of grated Parmigiano.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>

                Repeat these steps for at least five layers<br> 
                (lasagna – bolognese sauce – bèchamel – 
                parmigiano),<br> in any case up to fill your 
                baking dish.
                
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>

            Finish by covering the last layer with plenty of 
            Parmigiano cheese,<br> that cooking make a crispy crust.
            Bake at 190°<br> (380 F) for about 30 minutes.Let cool 
            Lasagna Bolognese<br> out of the oven for 10 minutes 
            before serving.
